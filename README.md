Business Cards is a printer system for QBox/QBX servers that lets players place a printer, save a photo URL, crop with drag/zoom, and print multiple cards. Printed cards keep the image and crop state, owners can pick up their printers, and everything runs through ox_target + ox_inventory with configurable limits. It includes live placement preview.
